We want to be able to run ensembles of HPC workloads in Kubernetes. While that can be done manually
with a bunch of Python scripts or pure grit, arguably a better approach is to automate it.
I created this with hopes of enabling my team to run experiments we need to do to better
understand HPC workloads in the cloud, and how we can take advantage of automation to
better orchestrate them.
