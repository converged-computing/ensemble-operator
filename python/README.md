# ensemble operator (python)

This is the Python grpc logic to place alongside the Flux scheduler in a MiniCluster (and TBA, others as well).
It will mean that:

- A cluster can be running one or more jobs
- The endpoint will deliver information about the status of the queue
- The MiniCluster can be requested to change in size depending on this status.
